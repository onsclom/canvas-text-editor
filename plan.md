the goal:
- make writing plain text and markdown fun
  - plain text + markdown is good cause it
  makes sense to continue using monospace.
  non monospace seems hard.
- it could be used for documents like this!

how to get there?
- more fundamental stuff
  - open and save files with file browser
  - cursor support
    - first just click certain spots to get 
    cursor there
    - click and drag to highlight
    - double click for words?
    - can i support right click?
  - keyboard
    - hot keys like copy and paste
    - ctrl + arrow keys for words and such
    - shift + arrow keys highlights?
  - automatic word wrapping
    - not sure how to handle this best yet
    - also margin and center the document nicely
- fun stuff
  - add sound on typing
  - add effects on deleting letters!
  - markdown syntax highlighting
